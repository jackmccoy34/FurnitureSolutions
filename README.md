<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project
This App was designed with the goal of saving time as a refrence system for employees of a furniture distribution company. This app contains four key data layers: a Order class, Product class, SalesRep class and Customer class. Order Class is able to be built with individual "Id" elements from Product, SalesRep, and Customer.

<p align="center">
Clone the software from the master branch
Begin with creating a login account in order to properly authenticate with the application. You will need to be logged into an account to have access to the information in the application. Once that is complete, you will be able to create your Customer. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
The API is loaded with premade products, customers, and salesreps. You will need a unique log in to be able to see the premade values. Once you're logged in you will be able to create, edit, view details, and delete Customers, SalesReps, and Products. 
<br><br>
When creating a new order, you must input valid Id's for Customer, SalesRep, and Product.
